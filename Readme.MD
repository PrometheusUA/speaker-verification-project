# Speaker verification project

**by Andrii Shevtsov, Artur Shevtsov and Maksym Palamariuk**

This is a realization of speaker verification system using pure numpy (PLDA technique) and its comparison with moer advanced methods, such as Siamese Convolutional Neural Networks.

## Folder structure

Folder structure is as follows:
- `features` folder is for feature extraction. Those features are mainly used in PLDA realization.
- `neural` folder is for neural network-based Speaker verification system realization.
- `plda` folder is for realization of the PLDA algorithm and its enhancements.
- `utils` folder is for other project-related stuff that is general or inconvinient to put into previous folders.
